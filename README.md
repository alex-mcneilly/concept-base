# Software Concepts Repository

An open-source collection of software concept definitions. This repository aims to document common software concepts in a structured way to help developers and designers create better software.

## What is a Concept?

A software concept is a reusable unit of functionality that:
- Is user-facing
- Has a clear purpose
- Can be understood independently
- Has well-defined behavior
- Is end-to-end (complete)
- Is often familiar to users
- Can be reused across applications
